Time transfers are transfers of services that are produced through unpaid care work (such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, household maintenance, direct care) and not captured in standard measures of economic activity. The estimates of time transfers are based on the methodology of National Time Transfer Accounts using time use surveys (Donehower 2019). The blue colours indicate age groups that are net givers of time – the time they spend with unpaid care work is higher than the amount they consume on average. The red colours indicate net receivers of time – on average their consumption of household services exceeds their time spent with unpaid care work. Even though some unpaid care work is done and transferred by these age groups (except for the youngest ones), the amount of time they consume from the work of others is higher.

The first figure is ordered according to the age of men age groups becoming net givers of time, the second Figure is oredered according to clustering the gender specific results. For more details on this see Vargha and Istenic 2023.
